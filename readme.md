### Build and Deploy a Customer Feedback Analysis System
You are tasked with developing a machine learning pipeline that analyzes customer feedback data to extract actionable insights. The system should handle data ingestion, preprocessing,  model training, and deployment for real-time predictions.

Requirements:

1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:
o Design a pipeline to handle raw customer feedback (e.g., text reviews) from multiple sources (CSV files, APIs).
Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing text.Identify and implement techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.
2. Model Development:
Train a machine learning model to classify feedback into predefined categories (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).
Explore and justify your choice of model(s) (e.g., traditional ML like Random Forests vs deep learning like BERT).
Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
3. Feature Engineering:
o Extract meaningful features from the feedback text (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings). Include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to support your feature selection decisions.
4. Model Deployment:
Develop an API to serve the model for real-time feedback classification. Ensure the API can handle high concurrency and provides predictions with low latency.
5. Monitoring and Feedback Loop:
Implement a basic monitoring system to track model performance over time (e.g., data drift, prediction accuracy).
Suggest a strategy to retrain the model periodically with new
data.
