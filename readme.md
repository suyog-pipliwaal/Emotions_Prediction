### Build Emotions Prediction for a Hackathon
Your task is to develop a robust image classification model capable of predicting the emotion depicted in an image. The training dataset contains labeled images along with their respective emotions, while the test dataset includes images for which predictions must be generated.


#### Data sources: Provided by MachineHack at https://machinehack.com/hackathons/emotions_prediction_hackathon/overview
Requirements:

1. Data Preprocessing:Normalize image data for better model performance.Perform data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to make the model more robust.

2. Model Development: Use pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet, fine-tuning them for emotion classification.
Experiment with custom CNN architectures to see if they outperform pre-trained models.

3. Training and Optimization:
Employ techniques like learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and dropout regularization to avoid overfitting.
Utilize libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras for efficient model building.
Validation and Testing:

Ensure your model generalizes well by using k-fold cross-validation.
Generate predictions for the test dataset in the required format

### Result:- Rank 4 (Gloabally)
